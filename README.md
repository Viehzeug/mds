# mds

`mds` = **M**ark**d**own **S**tructure

`mds` is a command line tool that displays the structure of a Markdown file and allows quick navigation by directly jumping to certain header.

## Status

This is just a tool I quickly threw together for personal usage. It currently only parses headers (which is enough to give a nice table of contents though) and has a couple of bugs.

More features will be added.

## Building

Navigate to the project directory and execute the `xcodebuild` command.

## Usage

`./mds <path_to_markdown_file>`
